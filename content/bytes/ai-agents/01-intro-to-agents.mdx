# Introduction to AI Agents

AI Agents are like having a smart assistant that can actually do things for you, not just answer questions.

## What Makes an Agent Different?

**Regular AI Chatbot**:
- You ask, it answers
- One-shot responses
- No memory beyond conversation
- Can't take actions

**AI Agent**:
- Can break down complex tasks
- Uses tools and APIs
- Has memory and context
- Takes autonomous actions
- Can plan and execute

## Simple Example

**Task**: "Research the top 5 AI tools launched last week and create a comparison table"

**Chatbot**: Gives you info from its training data (might be outdated)

**AI Agent**:
1. Searches the web for recent launches
2. Reads multiple sources
3. Extracts key information
4. Organizes into a table
5. Presents the final result

## Key Components of an Agent

1. **Planner**: Breaks down tasks into steps
2. **Memory**: Remembers context and previous interactions
3. **Tools**: Can use search, calculators, APIs, databases
4. **Executor**: Actually performs actions
5. **Reflection**: Learns from results and adjusts

## Real-World Use Cases

- Automated customer support (not just chat, but actually solving issues)
- Research assistants that gather and summarize information
- Code debugging and testing
- Data analysis and reporting
- Workflow automation

## Popular Agent Frameworks

- **LangChain**: Python framework for building agents
- **AutoGPT**: Autonomous GPT-4 agent
- **BabyAGI**: Task-driven autonomous agent
- **Claude Agent SDK**: Build agents with Claude

## Getting Started

To build an AI agent, you need:
1. An LLM (like Claude, GPT-4)
2. A framework (LangChain, custom code)
3. Tools/APIs for the agent to use
4. Clear instructions and guardrails
