# How LLMs Actually Work

LLM-னு சொன்னா Large Language Model. But எப்படி இது work பண்ணுது?

## The Basic Idea

Think of an LLM as a super-smart autocomplete.

Your phone keyboard suggests the next word:
- Type "Good" → suggests "morning", "night", "job"

LLMs do the same, but way more sophisticated:
- They predict the next word based on billions of examples
- They understand context way better
- They can generate entire paragraphs

## Training Process (Simple Version)

1. **Data Collection**
   - Read billions of web pages, books, code
   - Like studying the entire internet

2. **Pattern Learning**
   - Find patterns in how words appear together
   - Learn grammar, facts, writing styles

3. **Fine-Tuning**
   - Teach specific behaviors (be helpful, avoid harm)
   - Align with human preferences

## How It Generates Text

When you type a prompt:

1. **Tokenization**: Breaks your text into pieces
   - "Hello world" → ["Hello", " world"]

2. **Context Understanding**: Looks at ALL previous words
   - Not just the last word, but the entire conversation

3. **Probability Calculation**: Predicts next word
   - "The cat sat on the ___"
   - High probability: "mat", "chair", "floor"
   - Low probability: "banana", "cloud"

4. **Selection**: Picks a word (with some randomness)
   - Too predictable = boring
   - Too random = nonsense

5. **Repeat**: Generates word by word until done

## Why Temperature Matters

**Temperature = 0** (Deterministic)
- Always picks the most likely word
- Consistent, predictable output
- Good for: code, factual answers

**Temperature = 1** (Creative)
- Adds randomness to word selection
- More creative, varied responses
- Good for: stories, brainstorming

## Limitations to Remember

- **No Real Understanding**: Just pattern matching (very sophisticated, but still)
- **Training Cutoff**: Doesn't know events after training
- **No Internet Access**: Can't browse (unless given tools)
- **Can Make Mistakes**: "Hallucinations" = confident wrong answers
