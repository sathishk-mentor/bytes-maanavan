# Basic Prompting Techniques

Master the foundational skills of prompt engineering to get better results from AI models.

## Why Prompting Matters

இன்னைக்கி AI-ஓட பேசுறது ஒரு skill ஆயிடுச்சு. You need to know how to ask the right questions to get the right answers. Just like how you'd talk differently to your boss vs your friend, you need to adapt your prompts based on what you want.

## Core Concepts

When crafting prompts, focus on three key elements:

1. **Clarity**: Be specific about what you want
2. **Context**: Provide relevant background
3. **Constraints**: Define boundaries and formats

### Example: Professional Email

Bad prompt:
```
Write me an email
```

Good prompt:
```
Write a professional email to my manager requesting time off for a medical appointment next Tuesday.

Tone: Respectful and concise
Length: 3-4 sentences
Include: Specific date and willingness to discuss coverage
```

## The SPEC Framework

- **S**pecific: Clear about what you want
- **P**urpose: Why do you need this?
- **E**xamples: Show what good looks like
- **C**onstraints: Length, tone, format

## Key Takeaways

- Always specify tone and format expectations
- Provide context for better responses
- Use examples when possible
- Iterate and refine based on results

## Common Mistakes

- Being too vague: "Write me an email"
- Not specifying tone or audience
- Forgetting to include key details
- Not providing output format requirements
