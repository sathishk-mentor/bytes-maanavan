# Advanced Prompting Strategies

Ready to level up? இப்போ advanced techniques பார்க்கலாம்!

## Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Instead of asking for a direct answer, ask the AI to show its reasoning.

**Without CoT:**
```
What's 25% of 80?
```

**With CoT:**
```
Calculate 25% of 80. Show your step-by-step calculation.
```

The AI will break down:
1. 25% = 25/100 = 0.25
2. 0.25 × 80 = 20
3. Answer: 20

## Few-Shot Learning

Provide examples to guide the AI's responses.

```
Convert these phrases to formal English:

Example 1:
Informal: "gonna go there"
Formal: "I am going to attend"

Example 2:
Informal: "wanna check it out"
Formal: "I would like to review it"

Now convert:
Informal: "lemme know ASAP"
Formal: [AI generates formal version]
```

## Role-Based Prompting

Assign a specific role to the AI for better context.

```
You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience.
Review this code and provide feedback on design patterns used.

[paste code here]
```

## Output Structuring

Specify exactly how you want the output formatted.

```
List 5 benefits of exercise.

Format:
- Benefit: [brief description]
- Impact: [who benefits most]
- Evidence: [supporting fact]
```

## Key Takeaways

- Chain-of-thought gets better reasoning
- Few-shot examples improve accuracy
- Role-based prompts add expertise
- Structure your desired output format
- Combine techniques for best results
